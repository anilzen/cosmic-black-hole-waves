# Black hole waves in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime
A simple Python solver for scalar waves in a cosmological spacetime with a black hole.

The code uses horizon-penetrating hyperboloidal coordinates in the static patch of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. The coordinates have two advantages:
- No boundary conditions need to be applied;
- Radiation leaves the numerical domain smoothly through the boundaries.
